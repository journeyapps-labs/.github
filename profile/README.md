## JourneyApps Labs

An experimental R&D division within JourneyApps that aims to share some of our in-house technologies that contribute to many of our software platforms, user interfaces and behind-the-scenes cloud systems.

Many of these technologies have been crafted over many years and have been tried and tested in production with a multitude of use cases. Some of the technologies are more experimental, but we will mark those accordingly.

Our mission with these technologies is to empower companies (especially startups) with the tools to create cutting-edge developer tools and experiences, and to help foster a community of awesome software that punches far above its own weight.
